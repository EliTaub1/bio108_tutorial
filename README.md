# Tutorial for Data Science for Conservation Bio

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook, which can be used as a tutorial for extracting climatic variables from a raster and analyzing them to determine habitat preference between cephalopod families.

Files:

* `cephalopod_salinity.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook that can be accessed as a Colab notebook containing the workflow for the cephalopod_salinity project
* `cephalopod_SDM_HW11.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook extending the SDM work on Todaropsis eblanae by examining importance aquatic parameters in determining its distribution
